This repository is an artifact storing the tex sources and the Julia scripts
used to generate the results in the manuscript "Condensed-space methods for nonlinear programming on GPUs",
available on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14236).

- The directory `HybridKKT.jl/` stores the Julia implementation of the method presented in the paper.
- The directory `tex/` stores the tex sources.
- The directory `scripts/` stores script files to generate the plots presented in the paper using `matplotlib`.
