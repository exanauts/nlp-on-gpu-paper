(SIAM J Sci Comput 32:3447--3475, 2010), a method that possesses global convergence guarantees to first-order stationary points with the novel feature that inexact search direction calculations are allowed in order to save computational expense. The implementation follows the proposed algorithm, but includes many practical enhancements, such as functionality to avoid the computation of a normal step during every iteration. The implementation is included in the IPOPT software package paired with an iterative linear system solver and preconditioner provided in PARDISO. Numerical results on a large nonlinear optimization test set and two PDE-constrained optimization problems with control and state constraints are presented to illustrate that the implementation is robust and efficient for large-scale applications.},

  abstract = {We study the solution of block-structured linear algebra systems arising in optimization by using iterative solution techniques. These systems are the core computational bottleneck of many problems of interest such as parameter estimation, optimal control, network optimization, and stochastic programming. Our approach uses a Krylov solver (GMRES) that is preconditioned with an alternating method of multipliers (ADMM). We show that this ADMM-GMRES approach overcomes well-known scalability issues of Schur complement decomposition in problems that exhibit a high degree of coupling. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated using linear systems that arise in stochastic optimal power flow problems and that contain up to 2 million total variables and 4000 coupling variables. We find that ADMM-GMRES is nearly an order of magnitude faster than Schur complement decomposition. Moreover, we demonstrate that the approach is robust to the selection of the augmented Lagrangian penalty parameter, which is a key advantage over the direct use of ADMM.},

Without data transfers between CPU and GPU, our implementation has achieved the elimination of a major performance bottleneck under a memory-bound situation, particularly when solving many small problems in batch. We discuss the design principles and implementation details for our kernel function and core operations. Different design choices are justified by numerical experiments. By using the application of distributed control of alternating current optimal power flow, where a large problem is decomposed into many smaller nonlinear programs using a Lagrangian approach, we demonstrate computational performance of ExaTron on the Summit supercomputer at Oak RidgeNational Laboratory. Our numerical results show the linear scaling with respect to the batch size and the number of GPUs and more than 35 times speedup on 6 GPUs than on 40 CPUs available on a single node.},
