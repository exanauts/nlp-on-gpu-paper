\begin{abstract}
  This paper explores two condensed-space interior-point methods to efficiently solve large-scale nonlinear programs on graphics processing units (GPUs). The interior-point method solves a sequence of symmetric indefinite linear systems, or Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) systems, which become increasingly ill-conditioned as we approach the solution. Solving a KKT system with traditional sparse factorization methods involve numerical pivoting, making parallelization difficult. A solution is to condense the KKT system into a symmetric positive-definite matrix and solve it with a Cholesky factorization, stable without pivoting. Although condensed KKT systems are more prone to ill-conditioning than the original ones, they exhibit structured ill-conditioning that mitigates the loss of accuracy. This paper compares the benefits of two recent condensed-space interior-point methods, HyKKT and LiftedKKT. We implement the two methods on GPUs using MadNLP.jl, an optimization solver interfaced with the NVIDIA sparse linear solver cuDSS and with the GPU-accelerated modeler ExaModels.jl. Our experiments on the PGLIB and the COPS benchmarks reveal that GPUs can attain up to a tenfold speed increase compared to CPUs when solving large-scale instances.

\section{Conclusion}
This article moves one step further in the solution of generic nonlinear
programs on GPU architectures. We have compared two approaches
to solve the KKT systems arising at each interior-point iteration, both
based on a condensation procedure.
Despite the formation of an ill-conditioned matrix, our theoretical analysis shows that the loss of accuracy is benign in floating-point arithmetic, thanks to the specific properties of the interior-point method.
Our numerical results show that both methods are competitive to solve large-scale
nonlinear programs.
Compared to the state-of-the-art HSL linear solvers, we achieve a 10x speed-up on large-scale OPF instances and quasi-dense instances (\texttt{elec}). While the results are more varied across the instances of the COPS benchmark, our performance consistently remains competitive with HSL.

Looking ahead, our future plans involve enhancing the robustness of the two condensed KKT methods, particularly focusing on stabilizing convergence for small tolerances (below $10^{-8}$).
It is worth noting that the sparse Cholesky solver can be further customized to meet the specific requirements of the interior-point method~\cite{wright1999modified}.
% Add a sentence about NCL on GPU?
Enhancing the two methods on the GPU would enable the resolution of large-scale problems that are currently intractable on classical CPU architectures such as multiperiod and security-constrained OPF problems.
