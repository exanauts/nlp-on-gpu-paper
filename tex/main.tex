\title{Nonlinear programming on GPU: current state-of-the-art}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Solving generic nonlinear programs requires the
  successive solution of large-scale indefinite symmetric matrix.
  The sparse factorization of such matrices relies
  on expensive numerical pivoting operations
  which are notoriously hard to parallelize on a GPU.
  A workaround is to reformulate the successive KKT systems
  in a form more amenable for the GPU, either by densifying
  it using a null-space method or by reducing it down
  to a symmetric positive-definite system, whose factorization using
  Cholesky run efficiently on the GPU.
  In this paper, we test three concurrent methods for solving
  KKT systems on the GPU using the newly released cuDSS solver,
  which implements the three sparse factorization routines LU, LDL
  and Cholesky, all offering uncompromising performance on NVIDIA GPU.
  We benchmark the three methods using various large-scale nonlinear programs,
  taken from the PGLIB and COPS benchmarks.
  We illustrate the advantages and the downsides of the three methods.
  We find that GPUs shine to compute quick and dirty results down to a medium convergence tolerance
  --- with a 10x speed-up compared to a state-of-the-art CPU routine --- but
  with a limited robustness.

\section{Conclusion}
Future extensions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Interplay with first-order method (PDHG for LP)
  \item Solving LP and QP problems on the GPU with IPM
  \item From Cholesky to LDL (regularization can
    ensure the KKT matrix is SQD, c.f. Orban, Saunders).
\end{itemize}
