\section{Introduction}
Why solving NLP on GPUs?
\begin{itemize}
  \item SIMD abstraction and batch evaluation
  \item GPU's performance has increased significantly in the last decade, on the contrary to CPUs (post Moore law)
  \item Our recent work has proved that when used properly,
    GPUs can solve large-scale NLP 10x faster than state-of-the-art (quote PSCC paper)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Current state-of-the-art (FP, SS)}

\paragraph{GPU for mathematical programming:}
General overview:
\begin{itemize}
  \item GPU used mostly in optimization for machine learning (Jaxopt, QPTH)
  \item Recent breakthrough in linear programming: a first-order
    algorithm --- PDHG --- beats Gurobi when running on the GPU.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{GPU for nonlinear programming:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Automatic differentiation: if AST represented with a SIMD abstraction,
    evaluation of the derivatives can be very fast (c.f. ExaModels)
  \item Linear solvers: current bottleneck, more than 90\% of the solution time spent
    inside the sparse linear solver.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Previous generation of sparse solvers (e.g. SPRAL)
        was lagging behind compared to their CPU equivalents (HSL and
        Pardiso being state-of-the art for nonlinear programming).
      \item New solvers released by NVIDIA (hidden sparse Cholesky, and now cuDSS).
        Sparse Cholesky is getting competitive on the GPU, as it avoids
        extensive numerical pivoting.
      \item Alternative way to solve the KKT system:
        iterative methods (Krylov with $K_{2.5}$ formulation)
        and hybrid methods (Golub \& Greif, cf HyKKT)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Contributions (FP)}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A new strategy based on equality relaxation
    and condensation of the KKT system
  \item Thorough comparison with alternative approaches
    (hybrid KKT solver and null-space solver), all implemented
    inside the same nonlinear optimization solver: MadNLP
  \item We test the latest sparse solver provided
    by NVIDIA: cuDSS
  \item Benchmark on large-scale OPF instances
    and others (to discuss)
\end{enumerate}
